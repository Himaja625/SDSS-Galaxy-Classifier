# SDSS Galaxy Classifier

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that classifies galaxies using machine learning models trained on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Users can input photometric and structural parameters to predict the galaxy type.

## Features
- Interactive galaxy classification form
- Machine learning-based prediction
- Clean UI with animated galaxy background
- Flask backend integration

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Three.js for background animation

## Dataset
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application:
python app.py

3. Open browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:2222/

## Output
The model predicts galaxy categories such as star-forming, starbursting, or passive galaxies.
